# Gif finder with Giphy API!

Search through gifs from the Giphy API!

## Features
* The website looks like a 90s geocities website, but I promise it's like that on purpose.
* 10 gifs not enough? The button at the bottom of the page will give you 10 more gifs from the same topic.
* The gifs are loaded in still to vastly improve load times. Click a gif to see its animated version.

## Works in progress
* Since the HTML5 download attribute does not work on conent from other servers, added a 1 click download button has become more difficult.
* Add a "favorites" button to save gifs in local storage
* Add a ratings filter
